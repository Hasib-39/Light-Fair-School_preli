# Challenge 2: Mofaâ€™s Kitchen Buddy

## Overview

Mofa's Kitchen Buddy is a backend system designed to help Mofa manage the ingredients in his kitchen and suggest recipes based on the available ingredients. The system is powered by an AI-driven chatbot integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM), allowing Mofa to interact with the system and receive personalized recipe recommendations based on his preferences, such as cravings or specific meal types.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main components:

- **Ingredient Management API**: Handles adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting ingredients.
- **Recipe Management API**: Manages storing and retrieving recipes, including parsing saved recipe text data.
- **Chatbot API**: Interacts with users and provides recipe suggestions based on available ingredients and preferences.
  
The backend is built with Django, and the project is structured to be scalable and maintainable.
